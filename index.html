	<h2>RPG - Role Playing Game</h2>
	<hr class="lajna">
<p>
	A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, as well as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games (<i>Including Dungeons & Dragons</i>) and use much of the same terminology, settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-basedconsole-window games into visually rich 3D experiences.

	<h2>DARK SOULS</h2>
	<hr class="lajna">

<p>
	<u><b>Dark Souls</b></u> is a third-person action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games for <i>PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows</i>. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternate areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas.
<br><br>
	Central to Dark Souls are Bonfires. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as check points for each level. When rested at, the player is healed to full, healing charges are restored, but all of the enemies (except for bosses, mini-bosses, and specific characters) respawn. While resting, players can level up and perform other key functions.
<br><br>
	Another aspect of Dark Souls is the <i>"humanity"</i> system. There are two "forms" the player character can be in during the game, human form and hollow form. Whenever the player dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item (also called a "humanity"). In order to gain the assistance of other players, the player must be in human form. While in human form, the player is subjected to invasions by other players and NPCs who seek to kill the player and restore their own humanity.
